# Relative Week

An API endpoint that display a number of week since an arbitrary date. It also support a response format that is used by Shields.io.

Note that the genesis data has to start on Sunday of the first week, otherwise, the next Sunday will still be counted as the first week.

## Dependencies

``` console
npm install
```

## Production Deployment

```console
gcloud functions deploy relative-week \
        --gen2 \
        --runtime=nodejs18 \
        --region=<region> \
        --source=. \
        --entry-point=relativeWeek \
        --trigger-http \
        --allow-unauthenticated
```

## Local Development

``` console
npm run start
```

``` console
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

## Test

``` console
npm test
```

## Note

### Features

- [ ] Obtain semester start date from the academic calendar.
- [ ] Show the dates that begins and ends the week (sun-sat).
- [ ] Show a week number relative to the given starting date.

## Design Note

### Alternative Implementation

```plain
1. Find the absolute week number of the genesis date -> genesisDateWeeks
2. Find the absolute week number of today -> todayWeeks
3. Subtract todayWeeks from genesisDateWeeks

absolute week number is the week number since the beginning of the year.
```

### Previous Implementation

https://github.com/krerkkiat/functions/tree/main/week-in-semester was for GCP's Cloud Functions.

### Obtaining the start date of a semester (from course offerring webapp)

In course offering webapp, the CS 3560 will have its own starting date listed. The webapp seems to have internal search API
that it is using already. If we can directly use this API, we should be reliably able to get the starting date.

Attempt to query all four semesters (fall, spring, 1st semester, 2nd semester). The `require_all=true` filters only event with all the keywords.
